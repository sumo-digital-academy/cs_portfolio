## Professional Summary
As a recent computer science graduate, I bring a robust skill set in software development, algorithms, and data structures. My academic background has equipped me with a solid foundation in programming languages such as Java, Python, and <span class="text-highlight">C++</span>, and I have successfully applied these skills to various projects throughout my coursework. 

I am particularly adept at problem-solving and possess a keen analytical mindset. My dedication to learning and staying on top of of the latest industry trends is evident in my engagement with <span class="text-highlight">portfolio projects</span> outside of my degree. With a passion for technology and a drive to contribute to innovative solutions, I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills in a dynamic professional setting. 

I am confident in my ability to adapt quickly, collaborate effectively, and make meaningful contributions to any team or project in the field of game development.

When you submit your CV to a large game studio, it will usually be subject to sifting by the recruitment team before it is seen by the relevant hiring manager. For junior game programmer positions, the recruitment team will typically be looking for C++ experience and a relevant portfolio of programming work - so make sure you make it obvious in your CV that you have these. If they aren't then your application may not get any further. Make sure that the url to your portfolio website is correct and publically accsible (ask a friend to try it). If you are sending a physical CV then shorten urls with a tool like tinyurl to make them easy to type.
  
  This is a brief summmary of a possible CV. A more detailed CV could be linked to on a different site. Alternatively, the text could say that a more detailed CV is available on request.
