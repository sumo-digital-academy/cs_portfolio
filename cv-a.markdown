## Professional Summary
As a recent computer science graduate, I bring a robust skill set in software development, algorithms, and data structures. My academic background has equipped me with a solid foundation in programming languages such as Java, Python, and <a href="https://sumo-digital-academy.github.io/cs_portfolio">C++</a>, and I have successfully applied these skills to various projects throughout my degree work and beyond. 

I am particularly adept at problem-solving and possess a keen analytical mindset. My dedication to learning and staying on top of of the latest industry trends is evident in my engagement with <a href="https://sumo-digital-academy.github.io/cs_portfolio">portfolio projects</a> outside of my degree. With a passion for technology and a drive to contribute to innovative solutions, I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills in a dynamic professional setting. 

I am confident in my ability to adapt quickly, collaborate effectively, and make meaningful contributions to any team or project in the field of game development.

<i>When you submit your CV to a large game studio, it will usually be subject to sifting by the recruitment team before it is seen by a hiring manager. For junior game programmer positions, the recruitment team will typically be looking for C++ experience and a relevant portfolio of programming work - so make sure you make it obvious early in your CV that you have these - otherwise your application may not get any further! Make sure that the url to your portfolio website is correct and publically accessible (ask a friend to try it). If you are sending a physical CV then shorten your urls with a tool like tinyurl to make them easy for others to type.</i>

## Education
### The University of Sheffield
2020 - 2023  
BSc (Hons) - Computer Science (First Class)
<br>
A traditional <a href="https://sumo-digital-academy.github.io/cs_portfolio/course">Computer Science degree</a> at a redbrick university.  

<span class="annotate-highlight">
<i>As a recent graduate, your undergraduate degree grade is important, and if you miss it off then the employer is likely to assume that you didn't do very well at your degree. You could also put a single overall figure representing your degree "score" here if you want to (average percentage or gpa), but it avoid going into much more detail than that. Listing your marks for every module tends to just highlight your weaknessess rather than your strengths.</i>
<br>
<br>
<i>Make sure to explain qualifications which aren't just a simple BSc or BA honours degree. Employers are often unaware of MComp / BEng / MEng qualifications or what the potential benefits might be, so make sure you make it clear on your CV.</i>
<br>
<br>
<i>Employers are less likely to be aware that postgraduate degrees have classification grades, but you have nothing to lose stating that you achieved a Merit or Distinction.</i>
<br>

### Sheffield College
2017 - 2020  
BTEC Level 3 - Computer Science (Double Distinction)

<span class="annotate-highlight">
<i>As a recent graduate, your A-Level or BTEC grades are potentially relevant - particularly in subjects like Physics and Maths. Be careful with BTEC qulifications insofar as employers may assume that a DD is a bad grade, not a double distinction!</i>
</span>
<br>

### Sheffield Academy School
2016 - 2017  
9 GCSEs including Maths (Grade 9 or A**) and English at (Grade 7 or B)

<span class="annotate-highlight">
<i>By the time you have a degree your GCSE subjects and grades are not particularly relevant to employers apart from Maths and English. If you have completed your GCSEs under the 9-1 grading system then it's worth including their equivalents as A-F grades </i>
