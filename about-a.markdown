<span class="annotate-highlight">
<i>It can be hard to know what an employer wants to know about you above and beyond your qualifications and work experience, but enthusiasm, self-direction, teamwork and resilience are all valuable attributes worth elaborating on when you have the opportunity to do so. The five sections below are designed precisely to emphasise these elements.</i>
</span>

## About Me

My name is Jo and I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Sheffield with <span class="text-highlight">a huge passion for game development</span>. I love <span class="text-highlight">the mix of tech and creativity that goes into making games</span>. My goal is to use my tech skills to create <span class="text-highlight">mind-blowing gaming experiences</span> for AAA games. This portfolio showcases my most up to date knowledge and skills as I work towards becoming a programmer in the <span class="text-highlight">exciting world of game development</span>.

<span class="annotate-highlight">
<i>Any employer would expect candidates to express enthusiasm for the industry/company they are applying to join, but this is especially true in games where there is significant competition. That doesn’t mean that everyone who works in the industry must be a die-hard gamer, but you do need to be excited about applying your technical skills to creative projects. It isn’t enough to just love playing games.</i>

## Independent Learner

I've always been a <span class="text-highlight">self-directed learner</span> when it comes to technology. Outside of my degree I've been keen to tinker with different programming languages and game engines, picking up tools like Unreal Engine along the way.  I’ve contributed to open-source C++ projects to help gain a robust foundation in the core language of the games industry. My <span class="text-highlight">independent approach to learning</span> has enhanced my technical skills and given me a <span class="text-highlight">proactive mindset  when it comes to navigating new technologies</span> which I believe will serve me well as a game programmer. 

<span class="annotate-highlight">
<i>One of the most important skills in technology industries is the ability to self-learn and stay up to date with new technologies and advancements. It’s important to show that you’re up for a challenge when it comes to new technologies as the games industry is constantly evolving and re-inventing itself for different platforms and audiences.</i>
</span>

## Teamwork

Participating in game jams has helped me to <span class="text-highlight">experience working in interdisciplinary teams</span> including artists, designers, and programmers. I've learned to navigate and contribute positively to a variety of team dynamics while crafting playable game prototypes within tight deadlines. This experience has taught me adaptability, open-mindedness and the importance of <span class="text-highlight">mutual respect to a collaborative creative process</span>. I would relish the opportunity to work in <span class="text-highlight">creative teams with diverse perspectives</span> in order to deliver innovative gaming experiences.

<span class="annotate-highlight">
<i>Most jobs involve teamwork, and you won’t get very far anywhere if you can’t get along with co-workers. However, the games industry is particularly diverse and collaborative, including disciplines which bring very different perspectives to technology and programming. You not only need to be able to show that you can work with creative disciplines, but treat their opinions and perspectives with equal respect to your own. That’s not easy to demonstrate on a typical CS programme, if you’ve only ever worked with other computer scientists, so game jams are a golden opportunity to get real experience in this area.</i>

## Wellbeing and Resilience

My university journey has enabled me to develop my own strategies for looking after my <span class="text-highlight">wellbeing and remaining resilient</span>. I’ve achieved a successful balance in my academic studies through a mindful approach to maintaining mental and physical health. I prioritize <span class="text-highlight">self-care through regular exercise</span> and hobbies, and recognize the role of peers and support networks in managing stress. <span class="text-highlight">Efficient time management</span> is at the heart of my approach to achieving my goals without compromising personal wellbeing. 

<span class="annotate-highlight">
<i>Resilience is particularly important in technology industries which have largely continued to work remotely. Remote working can be more isolating, so it is really important to have strategies for managing your own stress and anxiety. Research shows that people who exercise regularly have better mental health and emotional wellbeing, and lower rates of mental illness. Good time management also helps to avoid stress, and we all need to find our own strategies to manage our time effectively in a work environment. You will be more employable if you can show that you have already developed good practices during your degree.</i>

## Extra-curricular Activities

Outside of my studies, I love playing 5-a-side football. It's a great way to stay active and improve my teamwork skills. I'm also a regular at a local board game club, which is a fantastic social activity where I get to relax and enjoy some strategic thinking with friends. These activities provide a healthy balance to my academic pursuits, keeping me refreshed and connected beyond the world of coding.

<span class="annotate-highlight">
<i>Life isn’t just about coding and games and it’s always reassuring to see candidates demonstrate interests outside of their studies. As well as feeding into wellbeing and resilience, broader horizons help developers to be more creative and engage with different kinds of audiences for their games. Exercise is also a good thing to see for the reasons mentioned above.</i>
