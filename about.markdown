## About Me

My name is Jo and I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Sheffield with a huge passion for game development. I love the mix of tech and creativity that goes into making games. My goal is to use my tech skills to create mind-blowing gaming experiences for AAA games. This portfolio showcases my most up to date knowledge and skills as I work towards becoming a programmer in the exciting world of game development.

## Independent Learner

I've always been a self-directed learner when it comes to technology. Outside of my degree I've been keen to tinker with different programming languages and game engines, picking up tools like Unreal Engine along the way.  I’ve contributed to open-source C++ projects to help gain a robust foundation in the core language of the games industry. My independent approach to learning has enhanced my technical skills and given me a proactive mindset  when it comes to navigating new technologies which I believe will serve me well as a game programmer. 

## Teamwork

Participating in game jams has helped me to experience working in interdisciplinary teams including artists, designers, and programmers. I've learned to navigate and contribute positively to a variety of team dynamics while crafting playable game prototypes within tight deadlines. This experience has taught me adaptability, open-mindedness and the importance of mutual respect to a collaborative creative process. I would relish the opportunity to work in creative teams with diverse perspectives in order to deliver innovative gaming experiences.

## Wellbeing and Resilience

My university journey has enabled me to develop my own strategies for looking after my wellbeing and remaining resilient. I’ve achieved a successful balance in my academic studies through a mindful approach to maintaining mental and physical health. I prioritize self-care through regular exercise and hobbies, and recognize the role of peers and support networks in managing stress. Efficient time management is at the heart of my approach to achieving my goals without compromising personal wellbeing. 

## Extra-curricular Activities

Outside of my studies, I love playing 5-a-side football. It's a great way to stay active and improve my teamwork skills. I'm also a regular at a local board game club, which is a fantastic social activity where I get to relax and enjoy some strategic thinking with friends. These activities provide a healthy balance to my academic pursuits, keeping me refreshed and connected beyond the world of coding.
